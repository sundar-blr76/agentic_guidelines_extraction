**GOVERNANCE, STAFF OBLIGATIONS AND OBJECTIVES**
*   The Fund's "Long-Term Investment Objective" is to meet or exceed a real rate of return (net of inflation, as measured by the US Consumer Price Index: All Urban Consumers not seasonally adjusted) in US dollars over the long-term (15 years and longer) without undue risk of loss, that factors in the liabilities of the Fund and the Required Contribution Rate as defined in the Funding Policy. [GOVERNANCE, STAFF OBLIGATIONS AND OBJECTIVES.5, page 5]
*   In the short term (3 years), the Fund aims to meet or exceed the Policy Benchmark's returns while keeping Key Risk Indicators in line with OIM's Risk Management Framework. [GOVERNANCE, STAFF OBLIGATIONS AND OBJECTIVES.5, page 5]
*   OIM strives to ensure that all of its activities integrate the ideals of sustainable investing, including taking into account environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics, while remaining entirely consistent with our fiduciary responsibility to meet our Long-Term Investment Objective. [GOVERNANCE, STAFF OBLIGATIONS AND OBJECTIVES.6, page 5]

**PURPOSE AND PERIODIC REVIEW OF INVESTMENT POLICY STATEMENT**
*   A full-scale review and updating of the IPS will be undertaken in consultation with the Investments Committee and other stakeholders, and in light of the observations and suggestions provided by the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Board (Pension Board or UNJSPB) and taking into account the results of each Asset-Liability Management (ALM) Study, currently conducted once every four years. [PURPOSE AND PERIODIC REVIEW OF INVESTMENT POLICY STATEMENT.8, page 6]
*   In between these full-scale updates, the IPS remains a living document and will be continuously updated, amended and enhanced as needed by the RSG, in order to provide the Fund with the necessary flexibility and tools required to address specific market conditions or developments. [PURPOSE AND PERIODIC REVIEW OF INVESTMENT POLICY STATEMENT.9, page 6]

**INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT**
  **Section: Investment Parameters**
*   Safety is achieved by ensuring adequate asset class, geographic, currency, sector and industry diversification, by careful due diligence and documentation of investment recommendations, and by constant review of the portfolio in order to position it optimally in light of economic and geopolitical trends and resulting financial market movements. Nevertheless, all investments are subject to market risk. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Parameters.28, page 11]
*   Profitability requires that each investment at the time of purchase be expected to earn a positive total return, taking into account potential risks such as market risk and credit risk which may be mitigated but cannot be eliminated by diversification. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Parameters.29, page 11]
*   Convertibility is the ability to readily convert investments into liquid currencies. The fiduciary responsibility to the Fund's participants and beneficiaries mandates that due to the US dollar-based market valuation of the Fund, and the US dollar-based appraisal of its actuarial soundness, all investments, should be readily and fully convertible into US dollars. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Parameters.30, page 11-12]
*   Liquidity is the ready marketability of the assets in recognized sound, stable and competitive exchanges or markets. Liquidity is required to ensure that the portfolio can be restructured in the shortest possible time in order to enhance total return, to minimize potential losses, and meet the liquidity needs of the Fund. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Parameters.31, page 12]
*   In establishing liquidity needs of the Fund, OIM will take the following factors into consideration: (a) need for liquidity to meet payroll requirements in an array of currencies [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Parameters.32.a, page 12]
*   In establishing liquidity needs of the Fund, OIM will take the following factors into consideration: (b) need for funds to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Parameters.32.b, page 12]
*   In establishing liquidity needs of the Fund, OIM will take the following factors into consideration: (c) need for funds required for projected cash flows [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Parameters.32.c, page 12]
*   In establishing liquidity needs of the Fund, OIM will take the following factors into consideration: (d) need for a safety buffer [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Parameters.32.d, page 12]
*   The emphasis on liquidity shall be an investment consideration based on the expected short-term and long-term cash flow profile of the Fund. Managing liquidity to meet the Fund's requirements will be met by structuring the investment portfolio to maintain a sufficient allocation of funds in highly liquid securities or in cash. OIM will consider an acceptable range of illiquidity to generate a higher return from the eligible investment universe. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Parameters.33, page 12]
*   It is noted that there may be attractive investment opportunities which require long-term commitments from the Fund. The Fund may invest in longer-term asset classes, such as private market investments with the concurrence of the RSG. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Parameters.34, page 12]

  **Section: Investment Time Horizon**
*   The purpose of the Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) as reflected in the Policy Benchmark is to achieve the Fund's Long-Term Investment Objective. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Time Horizon.35, page 12]
*   Therefore, strategic investment decisions for the Fund shall be made based on a long-term horizon. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Time Horizon.35, page 12-13]
*   Tactical tilts around the target SAA may be adopted for a short-term horizon to optimally position the Fund's portfolio in light of expected short-term financial market movements. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Time Horizon.35, page 13]

  **Section: Modeling Assumptions and Process**
*   In order to establish risk and liquidity parameters for the management of the assets of the UNJSPF, appropriate financial models may be used by OIM to estimate and calculate risk levels. OIM's Risk Team will perform stress tests for the UNJSPF's assets, based on extreme historical market events in addition to assuming instantaneous shocks for different asset classes. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Modeling Assumptions and Process.36, page 13]

  **Section: Investment Portfolio**
*   The SAA shall be designed to meet the Long-Term Investment Objective subject to the specified risk appetite as translated into appropriate risk metrics. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Portfolio.37, page 13]
*   The main asset classes in the SAA are comprised of Public Equities, Private Equity, Real Estate, Other Real Assets (Infrastructure, Timber, etc.), Fixed Income, and Cash. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Portfolio.37, page 13]
*   The Total Fund Policy benchmark is computed following a composite-weighted based methodology. It means that its return is determined by multiplying the performances of each asset classes respective benchmarks by their target weights, which are the target strategic asset allocation (SAA) weights defined in the IPS. However, instead of using fixed target (SAA) weights for Private Market investments (Private Equity, Real Estate, Infrastructure, Timberland and Farmland, and Private Debt), floating weights, corresponding to Private Markets portfolio weights, will be used instead. The difference between target (SAA) weights and portfolio weights for Private Market investments will be added back to Global Equities target (SAA) weight. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Portfolio.38, page 13-14]
*   Each asset class of the portfolio must stay within specified limits (see table above). [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Portfolio.39, page 15]
*   On a monthly basis, during OIM IIC (Internal Investment Committee), the portfolio weights by asset classes will be reviewed and, in case of any breach, the concerned asset class(es) will be rebalanced and put it back to SAA ranges. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Portfolio.39, page 15]
*   It is possible that Total Cash stay temporarily above the limits, but it needs to be remediated in within 90 days. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Portfolio.39, page 15]
*   ESG Custom means the MSCI, and Bloomberg US Aggregate indexes are adjusted for restrictions on investing in tobacco, controversial weapons, thermal coal and fossil fuel companies. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Portfolio.40, page 15]
*   Based on the long-term risk return characteristics of the Policy Benchmark, OIM may invest in eligible asset classes (Annex I), with the goal of achieving its Short-Term Investment Objective and/or its Long-Term Investment Objective. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Portfolio.41, page 15-16]
*   Annex I lists the eligible assets and instruments. OIM may (i) invest in all types of securities and assets consistent with its eligible investment universe, including without limitation: common stock; preferred stock; convertible stock; warrants; depositary receipts; American depository receipts; global depository receipts; exchange traded funds; money market funds; commercial paper; structured notes; bank deposits; limited partnership interests; real estate investment trusts; interests in closed and open-end collective investment funds; interests in funds of funds, and (ii) enter into the following types of transactions or investment structures: segregated investments accounts in the name of the Fund customized to the specific requirements of OIM; investments in single assets through one or more entities controlled by OIM; investments in single assets through one or more entities controlled by OIM in parallel with a collective investment fund or other institutional investor. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Portfolio.42, page 16]
*   OIM will consult with and obtain the IC's advice and guidance prior to completing its first investment in a new asset class or initial use of a new instrument. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Portfolio.43, page 16]
*   The Fund applies concentration limits for both internally and externally managed assets which are specified in the OIM Risk Manual. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Portfolio.44, page 16]
*   OIM may use exchange-traded futures, swaps, To Be Announced (TBA), Repo and Reverse Repo and F/X forwards for the purpose of risk management and hedging as per General Assembly (GA) mandate. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Portfolio.45, page 16]
*   OIM may use security lending program only for US Treasury to generate revenues. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Portfolio.45, page 16]
*   OIM may establish securities lending programs and enter into repurchase transactions to enhance returns. Due to reputational risk concerns, the securities lending program scope has been limited to US Treasury In order to facilitate the implementation of its investment strategies. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Investment Portfolio.46, page 16]

  **Section: Credit Rating Policy**
*   The credit risk framework is based on the composite risk rating of the following agencies: Fitch, Standard and Poor's (S&P) and Moody's. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Credit Rating Policy.47, page 17]
*   The minimum rating accepted for any rated eligible security is B-/B3 respecting the limits established for the individual securities. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Credit Rating Policy.47, page 17]
*   If the security does not have a public rating, the rating of the issuer can be used. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Credit Rating Policy.47, page 17]

*   An issuer rating may be used in lieu of a security rating [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Credit Rating Policy.47, page 17]

  **Section: Geographical Diversification**
*   The General Assembly has requested the Secretary-General in consultation with the Investments Committee, to ensure that, subject to careful observance of the requirements of safety, profitability, liquidity and convertibility, and in strict conformity with the Regulations of the UNJSPF, a larger proportion of the investment of the resources of the Fund is made in developing countries. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Geographical Diversification.48, page 17]

  **Section: Impact Investing**
*   The General Assembly has requested the Secretary General to explore, in consultation with the Investments Committee and taking into account the observations and suggestions by the Pension Board, impact investing for part of the portfolio, including in developing and emerging markets, such as Africa and Asia and other regions, bearing in mind the Fund's real rate of return target. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Impact Investing.49, page 21]

  **Section: Restricted/Prohibited Industries**
*   Investments in companies that derive any revenue from the production of tobacco and that primarily deal with manufacturing and distribution of tobacco and tobacco related products and non-transitioning fossil fuels companies including thermal coal are restricted. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Restricted/Prohibited Industries.50, page 21]
*   The Fund is prohibited from investing in securities of companies that derive any revenue from the production of military weapons, weapons systems or weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, or derive more than 10 per cent of their revenue from the production of customized components for purposes of the production of military weapons, weapons systems or weapons of mass destruction. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Restricted/Prohibited Industries.50, page 21]
*   While the Fund analyzes and monitors the individual holdings in Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and any other index or fund products, the individual holdings that fall under the criteria for restricted and prohibited industries and/or the minimum required credit ratings, may be maintained in the investable universe since these instruments grant access to specific markets that contribute to the overall safety, profitability, liquidity and convertibility of the total portfolio. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Restricted/Prohibited Industries.51, page 21]

  **Section: Mitigation of Reputational Risk**
*   OIM will strive, on a best-efforts basis, to ensure that the investments of the Fund conform to the high ethical standards of the United Nations, and do not expose the Fund to reputational risk. [INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT.Mitigation of Reputational Risk.52, page 21]

**RISK MANAGEMENT**
  **Section: Risk Monitoring**
*   Total Portfolio Risk – OIM will monitor and report the total portfolio Value at Risk (VaR), which assesses the Fund's potential loss, at different levels of probability of occurrence, and over different timeframes. The Risk Committee approves risk limits and reviews them periodically. [RISK MANAGEMENT.Risk Monitoring.62, page 24]
*   Active Risk - OIM will monitor and report the acceptable level of active risk expressed as the variation of the Fund's investment performance from the Policy Benchmark's performance (Tracking Error). Tracking Error is defined as one standard deviation of the difference between the return of the actual total Fund portfolio and the return of the Policy Benchmark (at the total Fund level), and versus individual asset class or portfolio benchmarks (for each asset class or individual portfolio). [RISK MANAGEMENT.Risk Monitoring.63, page 24]
*   OIM will monitor and report tracking error for the public markets components of the total Fund portfolio. The maximum allowable tracking error (or risk tolerance) for each public markets portfolio -- by asset class or region -- is reviewed on an annual basis and approved by the Risk Committee. [RISK MANAGEMENT.Risk Monitoring.64, page 24]
*   OIM will also determine an overall Risk Budget for active risk, with the objective of allocating risk among asset classes and individual portfolios where it may be used to add the most value to the total Fund portfolio. [RISK MANAGEMENT.Risk Monitoring.65, page 24]
*   Actual risk in various portfolios will be monitored (both ex-ante and ex-post) to ensure that it remains within the established risk tolerance and is reported weekly to the RSG as well as reviewed by the Risk Committee every quarter, or more frequently if required. [RISK MANAGEMENT.Risk Monitoring.66, page 24]
*   Risk in certain portfolios may temporarily exceed established risk limits during times of heightened market volatility or sustained instability. OIM has established yellow and red zones for risk limits. If a portfolio's risk strays into the red zone for a sustained period, OIM takes immediate action by adjusting that portfolio composition. [RISK MANAGEMENT.Risk Monitoring.67, page 24]

**Asset-Liability Management (ALM) Study**
*   A full ALM study is performed every four years unless the Pension Board considers it necessary to conduct an ALM study more frequently. The purpose of the ALM study is to examine the financial condition of the Fund, estimate the feasibility of achieving the desired long-term investment return targets, set an appropriate Long-Term Investment Objective consistent with maintaining the Fund's long-term financial sustainability, and propose a reasonable, feasible, and implementable Strategic Asset Allocation consistent with the Long-Term Investment Objective, the Fund's Risk Appetite and its current financial condition. [Asset-Liability Management (ALM) Study.68, page 25]

**OIM'S APPROACH TO SUSTAINABLE INVESTING**
*   The Fund restricts investments in the tobacco industry and in the securities of companies producing controversial weapons, including weapons of mass destruction as well as fossil fuel companies. OIM is using a customized equity and fixed income benchmark provided by a leading index provider to reflect these restrictions. [OIM'S APPROACH TO SUSTAINABLE INVESTING.71, page 25]
*   The Fund adheres to sustainable investment proxy voting guidelines in partnership with a leading global provider. OIM's sustainable voting policy generally references globally recognized sustainability-related initiatives such as the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). They promote a fair, unified and productive reporting and compliance environment. They advance positive corporate ESG actions which promote practices that present new opportunities or that mitigate related financial and reputational risks.
